        Summary:
        Implementing deep learning methods to 2D/3D registration of pre-op and intra-op data overcomes the difficulties that the conventional methods cannot handle. Explicit formalization of complicated mapping is no longer necessary, but with a better performance.

        Summary:
        The evolutionary algorithm has progressive effect recent years when working on feature selection which is the most important part of machine learning and data mining. This project aims to create a parallel environment for MOEA/D algorithm, using the island model and find out an effective way in which partial data would be used for communication. We use feature selection to verify our proposal in the whole process.
